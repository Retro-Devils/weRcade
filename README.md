## webЯcade: Feed-driven gaming

  
WebЯcade consists of an intuitive web-based front end that enables playing popular gaming content entirely within the context of the browser across a wide variety of platforms (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS). Gamepads are supported (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games.

The content for playing games (binaries, etc.) and populating the front-end (images, etc.) is collected from cloud-based resources based on user-defined feeds. Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. Application types include emulators (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and game engines (Classic Doom).
